  Create your personal schedule for Devoxx. Each time you register for a session, that's a vote.
  A vote that can change the balance in a fight. But which fight? Java vs Scala. Your favorite speaker vs Mister boring.
  Room B vs Room A. Any fight that you'll come up with and share with other users.

  This site will be coded LIVE at Devoxx by the <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Code+Story">CodeStory
