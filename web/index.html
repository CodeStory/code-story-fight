  <p>Create your personal schedule for Devoxx. Each time you "Star" a session, that's a vote.
    A vote that can change the balance in a fight. But which fight? Java vs Scala. Your favorite speaker vs Mister
    boring.
    Room B vs Room A. Any fight that you'll come up with and share with other users.</p>

  <p>This site will be coded live at Devoxx by the <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Code+Story">CodeStory
    Team</a>.</p>
