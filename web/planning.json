The only mature modularity approach for Java is OSGi - a framework that enables low-level modularity and services, but you still need APIs to create web applications, use transactions, access data sources etc. Without these APIs you will have a hard time building applications. Unfortunately OSGi and Java EE did not interoperate well in the past; But what if we want modularity in our architecture but also the ease-of-use of Java EE 6? In this university you will:\r\n\r\n1.

However, it is a well-known problem that complex HQL queries, with many joins across class hierarchies, may perform very poorly, especially if executed on large databases. In such cases, Hibernate developers often escape to native SQL, giving up the object perspective and compactness of queries. Complex SQL queries are, however, cumbersome and difficult to maintain. FastOQL solves this problem by producing optimal SQL queries with a minimal number of joins from object queries. FastOQL is a Java library that compiles OQL (Object Query Language) queries into efficient SQL queries. It is designed to work with Hibernate, as an alternative to its HQL, to address its performance and scalability problems. If the domain model has inheritance hierarchies and/or collections mapped to association tables, FastOQL can bring substantial performance benefits.","room":"Room 4","speaker":"Žarko Mijailović","day":"2012-11-13","from":"17:25","to":"17:55","type":"Tools in Action","speakers":["Žarko Mijailović","Srđan Luković","Dragan Milicev"],"tags":["ORM","performance","Hibernate","sql"]},{"id":820,"title":"10 Months of MongoDB at Nokia Entertainment Bristol","uri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/1650","summary":"A look at how a small group of self-motivated developers went about introducing, first themselves, and then their organisation to MongoDB.

Attend this session for the JSR update, discussion of the API, and information on how to utilize this API in applications.","room":"Room 8","speaker":"Jitendra Kotamraju","day":"2012-11-15","from":"15:10","to":"16:10","type":"Conference","speakers":["Jitendra Kotamraju"],"tags":["JSON"]},{"id":920,"title":"JavaPosse LIVE","uri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/2084","summary":"LIVE recording of the 400th JavaPosse podcast.","room":"Room 5","speaker":"Dick Wall","day":"2012-11-15","from":"15:10","to":"16:10","type":"Conference","speakers":["Dick Wall","Carl Quinn","Tor Norbye"],"tags":["JavaPosse","Podcast"]},{"id":921,"title":"An analysis of CVE-2012-2122, MySQL authentication","uri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/2087","summary":"An examination of the recently publicised MySQL authentication bypass, technically known as CVE-2012-2122 and how this flaw came to be.

Especially porting your existing GWT apps becomes incredibly easy.\r\nWith Phonegap you can build cross platform apps based on web standards. This can be done with Javascript. GWT on the other hand is an excellent tool for building fast Javascript apps in Java, but it is missing some key parts for building great mobile apps with it. The two open source projects mgwt and gwt-phonegap close this gap: mgwt provides mobile widgets, that look like native widgets for different platforms - gwt-phonegap enables GWT apps to use Phonegap. \r\nPutting these frameworks to work creates performant mobile apps that feel like native apps while being platform independent.","room":"Room 9","speaker":"Daniel Kurka","day":"2012-11-16","from":"10:45","to":"11:45","type":"Conference","speakers":["Daniel Kurka"],"tags":["HTML5","iPhone","performance","CSS3","GWT","javascript","mobile","android"]},{"id":957,"title":"Les Cast Codeurs Podcast","uri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/2097","summary":"LIVE recording of the Cast Codeurs Podcast (French)","room":"BOF 1","speaker":"Emmanuel Bernard","day":"2012-11-16","from":"10:45","to":"11:45","type":"BOF","speakers":["Emmanuel Bernard","Vincent Massol","Guillaume Laforge","Antonio Goncalves"],"tags":["Podcast"]}]},{"slot":"11:50","talks":[{"id":958,"title":"Real World Java EE","uri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/2064","summary":"tba","room":"Room 8","speaker":"Adam Bien","day":"2012-11-16","from":"11:50","to":"12:50","type":"Conference","speakers":["Adam Bien"],"tags":["Glassfish","javaee"]},{"id":959,"title":"Building Modular Applications with Enterprise OSGi","uri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/1963","summary":"Every Java EE developer is familiar with WAR files and Servlets, and most are familiar with Spring and dependency injection. Those who have used these two technologies together are also painfully aware of how hard it can be to manage the class path and class loaders of their application as they add more library JARs.\r\n\r\nOSGi offers the perfect modularity solution for this “class path hell”, but few developers are aware that you can use WARs and dependency injection within an OSGi framework.\r\n\r\nMoving Java EE applications to an OSGi stack is as easy as possible. In this session we will discuss the basics of the OSGi modularity model, and demo the build tools, middleware, and architectural principles which can be used to turn a chunky WAR into a lean, mean, extensible OSGi web application ! \r\n\r\nWhilst his session is primarily aimed at enterprise developers new to OSGi, much of the content is equally applicable to OSGi development, and is recommended to anyone looking to brush up on their OSGi principles","room":"Room 5","speaker":"Holly Cummins","day":"2012-11-16","from":"11:50","to":"12:50","type":"Conference","speakers":["Holly Cummins","Timothy Ward"],"tags":["javaee","osgi"]},{"id":960,"title":"Putting Kotlin to the test","uri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/1887","summary":"Kotlin is a new OSS programming language from JetBrains, leaders of IDE’s and Developer tools. Its purpose is to provide a general industry focused language that can be used for all types of development, and at the same time, fixing some of the common pitfalls of other languages that can end up being very expensive. That’s the idea behind it at least, but does it hold? In this session we’re going to find out. We’ll put it to the test by creating a real-world application and see if and where it can help and whether it has enough the potential to be a prime runner!","room":"Room 4","speaker":"Hadi Hariri","day":"2012-11-16","from":"11:50","to":"12:50","type":"Conference","speakers":["Hadi Hariri"],"tags":["JVM"]},{"id":961,"title":"J2ObjC - A Java to iOS Objective-C translation tool and runtime.","uri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/2112","summary":"J2ObjC is a new build tool that translates Java library source for use with iOS apps.
